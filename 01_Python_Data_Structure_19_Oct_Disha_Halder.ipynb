This issue is avoided by immutability, which maintains the structure of the dictionary.\n",

Lists and dictionaries are examples of mutable types that cannot be used as keys because their content changes, affecting hash values and perhaps causing issues with lookup or retrieval. Because lists can be changed, using my_list as a key causes an error. Making keys unchangeable improves the efficiency of dictionaries."
